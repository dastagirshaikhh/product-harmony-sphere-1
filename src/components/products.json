          "description": "Data loss prevention is a security solution that identifies and helps prevent unsafe or inappropriate sharing, transfer, or use of sensitive data. It can help your organization monitor and protect sensitive information across on-premises systems, cloud-based locations, and endpoint devices. It can also help discover the sensitive data across endpoints where data can be stored on local storages, PSTs, common folders. Endpoint Prevent and Endpoint Discover both apply Data Loss Prevention policies to protect your sensitive or at-risk data. Sensitive or at-risk data can include credit card numbers or names, addresses, and identification numbers. You can configure both of these products to recognize and protect the files that contain sensitive data.\n\nEndpoint Prevent stops sensitive data from moving off endpoints and supported virtual desktops. For example, Endpoint Prevent can stop a file that contains credit card numbers from being transferred to eSATA, USB, or FireWire-connected media. Endpoint Prevent stops sensitive files from being transferred to network shares. And Endpoint Prevent can monitor and prevent data from being transferred to applications you specify.\n\nEndpoint Discover scans the internal hard drives of an endpoint to identify stored confidential data so steps can be taken to inventory, secure, or relocate this data. It enables high-performance, parallel scanning of tens of thousands of endpoints with minimal system effect. Each DLP Agent can scan approximately 5 GB/hr. Users can set up Endpoint Discover scans to use multiple Endpoint Servers to increase performance and scan availability. Endpoint Discover can automatically quarantine confidential files either locally to a folder on the Windows endpoint computer (including to an encrypted folder) or remotely to a folder on the network.",
